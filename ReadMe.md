## How the Project Works

- The application starts from the `lists.js` file, which acts as the main entry point. When the app loads, `lists.js` is responsible for initializing the UI, loading all lists from Trello, and setting up the main event listeners. Most loading functions and the initial rendering logic are found here.

- **File Responsibilities:**
  - `lists.js`: Main entry point. Loads lists from Trello, initializes the app, manages list-related UI and logic, and triggers loading of cards for each list.
  - `api_calls.js`: Handles all communication with the Trello API, including loading, creating, updating, and deleting lists, cards, checklists, and check items. All network requests are managed here.
  - `cards.js`: Manages card operations such as creating, editing, deleting, and rendering cards within lists. Also handles card-specific UI interactions and triggers loading of checklists for each card.
  - `checklist.js`: Manages checklists within cards, including loading, creating, updating, and deleting checklists. Handles checklist UI and logic.
  - `checkitems.js`: Handles individual checklist items, including adding, renaming, marking as complete/incomplete, and deleting check items. Manages check item UI and state updates.
  - `config.js`: Stores your Trello API key, token, and board ID. This file is used by `api_calls.js` to authenticate requests. (Note : create this file with your credentials as per the instructions below)
